### Key Architectural Patterns

**1. Enum-Based RBAC**
All role checks use PHP enums in `App\Enums\`:
- `UserRole::Teller`, `UserRole::Manager`, `UserRole::ComplianceOfficer`, `UserRole::Admin`
- Permission methods on enums: `$role->canApproveLargeTransactions()`, `$role->canViewReports()`
- All status/type enums organized by domain (Transaction, Customer, Session, Compliance, Accounting, Alert)
- Models return enum instances, not strings

**2. Service Layer**
Controllers inject services via constructor dependency injection (no `app()` service locator):
```php
public function __construct(
    protected CurrencyPositionService $positionService,
    protected ComplianceService $complianceService,
) {}
```

**3. Double-Entry Accounting**
- `AccountingService` creates journal entries for every transaction
- `LedgerService` maintains running balances
- `RevaluationService` handles monthly currency revaluation
- Account codes use `AccountCode` enum (e.g., `AccountCode::CASH_MYR->value`)

**4. BCMath Precision**
All monetary calculations use `App\Services\MathService` (BCMath), not floats. Never cast money values to `float`.

**5. Compliance Workflow**
- Transactions ≥ RM 50,000 require manager approval
- `ComplianceService` runs CDD determination and CTOS reporting (both Buy and Sell)
- `TransactionMonitoringService` runs automated compliance monitors via background jobs:
  - `VelocityMonitor` - Detects velocity/structuring patterns (7-day lookback)
  - `StructuringMonitor` - Transaction aggregation detection
  - `SanctionsRescreeningMonitor` - Monthly rescreening of all customers
  - `StrDeadlineMonitor` - STR submission deadline tracking
  - `CustomerLocationAnomalyMonitor` - Geographic anomaly detection
  - `CurrencyFlowMonitor` - Currency flow pattern analysis
  - `CounterfeitAlertMonitor` - Counterfeit currency detection
- `AlertTriageService` triages and assigns compliance alerts
- `CustomerRiskScoringService` calculates customer risk scores with lock/unlock capability
- **CTOS Submission**: `POST /api/v1/compliance/ctos/{id}/submit` - Submit CTOS reports to BNM with compliance officer sign-off
- All cancellations require manager approval via `PendingCancellation` status (segregation of duties)

**6. Event-Driven Architecture**
Events fire for critical operations (`TransactionCreated`, `CounterSessionOpened`, etc.) with listeners for audit logging, notifications, and compliance triggers.

**7. Background Processing**
Laravel queues handle async compliance screening, STR report submission, and sanctions rescreening via `App\Jobs\`.

**8. Role Hierarchy**
Permissions inherit upward: `Admin` > `ComplianceOfficer` > `Manager` > `Teller`.
- Managers can approve large transactions but not configure system settings
- Compliance Officers handle AML workflows, not daily operations

**9. Security Features**
- MFA required for ALL roles including Tellers (BNM compliance)
- IP-based blocking after 10 failed login attempts (5-minute window, 1-hour block duration)
- Strict rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (login: 5/min, API: 30/min, transactions: 10/min, STR: 3/min, bulk: 1/5min, export: 5/min, sensitive: 3/min)
- Session timeout (configurable, default 8 hours)
- Audit log with cryptographic hash chaining (tampering protection)
- Password complexity requirements (min 12 chars, mixed case, number, special char, max 5 attempts, 15-min lockout)
- HSTS support (configurable max-age, includeSubDomains, preload)
- IP whitelist support (exact IPs and CIDR notation)

**Note on MFA scope**: MFA is enforced on sensitive operations (transaction creation, approvals, admin functions). Non-sensitive read operations (viewing transactions, customers, counters) do not require MFA.

### Middleware Stack

Routes use these middleware:
- `auth` - All authenticated users
- `role:manager` / `role:compliance` / `CheckRoleAny` - Role-based access control
- `EnsureMfaEnabled` / `EnsureMfaVerified` - MFA enforcement
- `DataBreachDetection` - Data breach monitoring and alerting
- `StrictRateLimit` - BNM-compliant rate limiting with burst protection
- `IpBlocker` - IP-based blocking after repeated failed attempts
- `SecurityHeaders` - HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- `session.timeout` - Idle session timeout
- `CheckBranchAccess` - Branch-based access control
- `LogRequests` / `QueryPerformanceMonitor` - Request logging and monitoring

### Key Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `AccountingService` | Journal entry creation and reversal |
| `LedgerService` | Trial balance, P&L, balance sheet |
| `RevaluationService` | Monthly currency revaluation |
| `CounterService` | Till/counter lifecycle (open, close, handover) |
| `TransactionService` | Core transaction operations |
| `ComplianceService` | CDD determination and CTOS reporting |
| `TransactionMonitoringService` | Automated compliance monitoring |
| `CustomerRiskScoringService` | Customer risk scoring with lock/unlock |
| `StrReportService` | Suspicious Transaction Report generation |
| `EddService` | Enhanced Due Diligence workflow |
| `CaseManagementService` | Compliance case management |
| `MathService` | BCMath precision calculations |
| `AuditService` | Audit log with hash chaining verification |

### Counter Management

Counters (tills) with full lifecycle:
- `/counters/{counter}/open` - Open counter with opening floats
- `/counters/{counter}/close` - Close counter with closing floats
- `/counters/{counter}/handover` - Transfer custody between users
- `/counters/{counter}/status` - Real-time counter status

**EOD Reconciliation** (`EodReconciliationService`):
- `GET /api/v1/eod/reconciliation/{date}` - Daily reconciliation summary
- `GET /api/v1/eod/reconciliation/{date}/counters/{counterId}` - Counter-specific reconciliation
- Artisan command: `php artisan report:eod --date=YYYY-MM-DD`

### Compliance & AML

**CDD Levels** (`CddLevel` enum):
- `Simplified` - Transaction < RM 3,000
- `Standard` - RM 3,000 to RM 49,999
- `Enhanced` - ≥ RM 50,000 OR PEP OR Sanction match

**CTOS Reporting**: Applies to ALL cash transactions (Buy and Sell) ≥ RM 10,000

**Structuring Detection**: 7-day lookback for aggregate transactions (configurable)

### Report Generation

BNM compliance reports via Artisan commands:
- `report:msb2` - Daily transaction summary
- `report:lctr` - Large Cash Transaction Report (≥ RM 50k) - **Monthly**
- `report:lmca` - Monthly LMCA
- `report:qlvr` - Quarterly Large Value
- `compliance:rescreen` - Monthly sanctions rescreening

- `tests/Feature/FiscalYearControllerTest.php` - Fiscal year creation, closing, opening
- `tests/Feature/FinancialStatementControllerTest.php` - Trial balance, P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, ratios
- `tests/Feature/JournalEntryWorkflowTest.php` - Journal draft → pending → posted workflow
- `tests/Unit/AmlRuleTest.php` - AML rule engine
- `tests/Unit/MathServiceTest.php` - BCMath precision
- `tests/Unit/CurrencyPositionServiceTest.php` - Stock/position calculations
- `tests/Unit/AuditServiceTest.php` - Hash chaining verification (`verifyChainIntegrity`)
- `tests/Unit/FinancialRatioServiceTest.php` - Liquidity, profitability, leverage, efficiency ratios
- `tests/Unit/CashFlowServiceTest.php` - Cash flow statement generation
- `tests/Unit/RiskRatingServiceTest.php` - Risk scoring (uses real DB, not facade mocks)
- `tests/Unit/ComplianceServiceTest.php` - CDD levels, sanctions, velocity, structuring (uses real DB)

## Important Conventions

- **Money**: Always use `MathService` or BCMath functions. Never use PHP `float` for currency.
- **Enums**: All magic strings (statuses, types, roles) should be converted to PHP enums.
- **Audit**: Critical operations must create `SystemLog` entries with hash chaining.
- **Hash Verification**: `AuditService::verifyChainIntegrity()` verifies the tamper-evident chain by recomputing each entry's SHA-256 hash and checking the `previous_hash` chain link. Returns `{valid: bool, broken_at: int|null, message: string}`. Call this method to detect any tampering with audit log entries.
- **RBAC**: Check permissions via enum methods, not string comparison.
- **Services over Controllers**: Business logic belongs in services, not controllers.
- **Encryption**: Use `EncryptionService` with random IV per encryption (IV prepended to ciphertext).
- **File Uploads**: Sanitize filenames with `basename()` or use `Str::uuid()` for naming.
- **Query Parameters**: Use parameterized queries for user-supplied values in LIKE clauses.
- **Cancellation**: ALL transaction cancellations require manager approval via `PendingCancellation` workflow.
- **Concurrency**: Use `lockForUpdate()` for position updates to prevent race conditions.
